            <p>If so, here’s a handy glossary (all in plain English) that’ll quickly get you up to speed and</p>
            <p>Once you understand basic website jargon, you’ll never get intimidated or befuddled the next</p>

            <h2>Basic Anatomy Of A Website</h2>
            <p>Let’s start by defining the various parts of a website:</p>
            <h3>Header</h3>
            <p>The header is the top section of a website, where you’ll usually find the logo and the site’s</p>
            <p>Years ago, headers often featured big banners or graphics to promote a brand—similar to the</p>

            <h3>Pre-Header</h3>
            <p>The pre-header is the thin strip that sits above the main header. It’s often used to display helpful</p>
            <img src="" alt="PRE-HEADER IMAGE">

            <h3>Favicon</h3>
            <p>A favicon is the small icon that appears in a browser tab next to your website title. It’s usually a</p>

            <h3>Navigation (aka Navigation Bar or Main Menu)</h3>
            <p>The navigation is the set of links at the top of a website that helps visitors find what they’re</p>
            <img src="" alt="NAVIGATION IMAGE">
            <p>On mobile devices, navigation links often transform into an icon with three stacked lines—</p>

            <p>For more complex websites with tons of pages, you might encounter a “mega menu.” This is a</p>
            <img src="" alt="MEGA MENU IMAGE">

            <h3>Breadcrumbs</h3>
            <p>Breadcrumbs are a type of navigation that shows visitors their location within a website’s</p>
            <i>Home > Blog > Latest Posts > Post Title</i>
            <p>Breadcrumbs make it easy for visitors to understand where they are on your site and quickly</p>

            <h3>Website Content</h3>
            <p>When it comes to written text, you’ll often hear it called web copy or body copy, but website</p>
            <p>Website content is everything on your site that communicates your message to visitors. It</p>

            <h3>Homepage (or home page)</h3>
            <p>The homepage — also called the front page or main page — is the starting point of most</p>
            <p>The homepage sets the tone for the entire website, giving visitors a quick sense of who you are,</p>
            <p>Common elements on a home page include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A hero area (headline and image) to grab attention.</li>
                <li>A navigation menu to help visitors find key pages.</li>
                <li>Links or sections highlighting your most important content, services, or calls to action.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A common website design best practice is to link your logo to the home page. This gives visitors</p>

            <h3>Homepage Hero Area (aka Feature Area aka Headline Area)</h3>
            <p>The Homepage Hero Area is the top section of a homepage that grabs your attention and</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A headline that clearly communicates the site’s purpose or the problem it solves.</li>
                <li>A sub-headline that adds supporting details or context.</li>
                <li>A call-to-action button to encourage visitors to take their next step, such as</li>
                <li>A visual element, such as an image, graphic, or video, that enhances the message</li>
            </ul>
            </li>

            <img src="" alt="HOMEPAGE IMAGE">

            <p>The term “hero” comes from traditional print media, where it referred to the main headline and</p>
            <h3>Slider</h3>
            <p>A slider is a feature on a website that displays a rotating series of images, like a slideshow. The</p>

            <img src="" alt="SLIDER IMAGE">

            <p>You’ll most often find sliders on homepages, either as a replacement for a hero image or as an</p>
            <p>While sliders used to be a common design trend, their popularity has decreased in recent years.</p>

            <h3>Website Content</h3>
            <p>When it comes to written text, you’ll often hear it called web copy or body copy, but website</p>
            <p>Website content is everything on your site that communicates your message to visitors. It</p>

            <h3>Alt Text</h3>
            <p>Alt text (short for “alternative text”) is a brief description added to images on a website. It serves
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>It makes websites more accessible by describing images to visually impaired users</li>
                <li>It helps search engines understand what an image is about, which can improve your</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example, if you have an image of an office space, instead of leaving it without a description,</p>

            <h3>Sidebar</h3>
            <p>A sidebar is the narrow vertical column that appears alongside your main website content. It’s</p>
            <p>In recent years, many websites have moved away from using sidebars altogether, opting instead</p>
            <img src="" alt="SIDEBAR IMAGE">

            <h3>Sub-Footer</h3>
            <p>The sub-footer is the section that appears at the bottom of a webpage—just above the main</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Quick Contact Information:</strong> Displaying addresses or phone numbers for immediate</li>
                <li><strong>Supplementary Navigation Links:</strong> Offering shortcuts to key pages like “About Us,”
                </li>
                <li><strong>Social Media Icons: </strong> Allowing visitors easy access to your social profiles.
                    Allowing visitors</li>
                <li><strong>Additional Resources:</strong> This might include links to site maps or ancillary
                    informational</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The sub-footer is designed to serve as an added layer of user convenience, enriching the overall</p>
            <img src="" alt="SUB-FOOTER IMAGE">

            <h3>Footer (The "True" Footer)</h3>
            <p>The footer is the final, definitive section at the very bottom of a webpage. It typically contains</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Copyright and Legal Disclaimers:</strong> Noting trademark rights and the copyright year.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Policy Links:</strong> Links to the privacy policy, terms of use, and any other legal
                    information.</li>
                <li><strong>Site Map:</strong> A detailed breakdown of the website’s structure for improved navigation
                    and SEO.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This section is static across the entire site and represents the definitive end point of your</p>
            <img src="" alt="IMAGE">
            <p><strong>Note:</strong>Although many people refer to both areas (i.e. sub-footer and footer) as the
                “footer,”</p>

            <h3>Landing Page</h3>
            <p>A landing page is a specific page on your website where visitors “land” after clicking on an ad—</p>
            <p>Landing pages are designed differently than regular website pages. Distractions like headers,</p>
            <p>The main goal of a landing page is to get the visitor to take a specific action—like downloading a</p>
            <p>Here's a <a href="" alt="">landing page example.</a></p>

            <h3>Call To Action (aka CTA)</h3>
            <p>A call to action (or CTA) is a specific and direct request asking visitors to take a desired action.</p>
            <p>A good call to action doesn’t have to be pushy or over-the-top. Sometimes a simple “click here” or</p>

            <h3>Above the Fold</h3>
            <p>“Above the fold” refers to the part of a webpage you immediately see before you start scrolling.</p>
            <p>The term “above the fold” comes from the newspaper industry, where the most important</p>

            <h3>Blog</h3>
            <p>A blog is a type of website—or a section of a larger website—that features content published as</p>
            <p>So what’s the difference between a blog and a standard website? It comes down to how the</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Blog posts are organized chronologically, often allowing for reader interactivity through</li>
                <li>Web pages (like the homepage, about page, or contact page) are static, not time-based</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Blogs also tend to have a more casual, conversational tone compared to standard web pages,</p>
            <p>A blog can stand alone as its own website, or it can live as a section within a larger website—just</p>
            <p>For more info on the similarities and differences between a blog and a website, <a href="" alt="">check
                    out my video</a></p>

            <h3>Card Design (aka Tile Design or Grid-Based Design)</h3>
            <p>Card design organizes content into visually distinct “cards” or tiles, often arranged in a grid</p>
            <p>Card design can be used in a variety of ways:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Image galleries</li>
                <li>Blog pages to showcase multiple posts</li>
                <li>Sales pages to highlight features, benefits, or services</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It’s a flexible, visually appealing way to present information. With a little creativity, the</p>

            <h2>Additional Terminology Of Modern Websites</h2>
            <h3>WordPress</h3>
            <p>WordPress powers millions of websites worldwide and is one of the most popular tools for</p>
            <p>Think of WordPress as the operating system for your website—similar to how Windows runs on a</p>
            <p>Here’s how WordPress works:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><Strong>Themes:</Strong> A WordPress theme controls how your site looks. It’s what transforms
                    WordPress</li>

            <p>Thanks to themes and plugins, WordPress makes it possible to build a custom, high-quality</p>

            <h3>WordPress Page vs. WordPress Post</h3>
            <p>This takes a bit of explaining, so I wrote a whole piece on the similarities and differences</p>

            <h3>Hosting</h3>
            <p>To have a website on the internet, it needs to be hosted on a web server. Think of hosting as the</p>
            <p>There are plenty of companies that offer website hosting services, like <a href=""> HostGator</a> or <a
                    href=""> BlueHost</a>,</p>

            <h3>Caching</h3>
            <p>Caching is the process of storing a temporary version of a website or webpage to help it load</p>

            <h3>Domain Name (aka URL)</h3>
            <p>A domain name is the address people type into their browser to visit a website—like</p>
            <p>Behind the scenes, every website is identified by an IP address, which is a long string of numbers</p>
            <p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> The term URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator — it’s the technical name for
                a web</p>

            <h3>Domain Registrar</h3>
            <p>A domain registrar is where you purchase and register your domain name—kind of like getting a</p>
            <p>There are plenty of domain registrars online, such as <a href="">NameCheap.com</a> or GoDaddy. Once you

            <h3>301 Redirect</h3>
            <p>A 301 redirect is a way to permanently send visitors (and search engines) from one URL to</p>
            <p>For example, if you change a page’s URL from yourwebsite.com/services to</p>

            <h3>404 Error Page</h3>
            <p>A 404 error page appears when someone tries to visit a page on your website that doesn’t exist</p>
            <p>While a default 404 page simply tells visitors the page can’t be found, a well-designed 404 page</p>

            <h3>DNS</h3>
            <p>DNS stands for Domain Name System. Think of it as the phone book of the internet.</p>
            <p>As mentioned earlier, humans use domain names (like markbrinker.com) instead of long, hard-</p>
            <a href="">resume here</a>

            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and it’s the standard language used to create</p>
            <p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> HTML inspired the name of the original Hotmail email service, launched in
                1996. The</p>

            <h3>CSS</h3>
            <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. While HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage,</p>
            <p>CSS also determines how a website appears on different devices, ensuring it looks great whether</p>

            <h3>Website Builder</h3>
            <p>A <strong>website builder</strong> is an all-in-one tool that allows you to design and build a website
                without</p>
            <p>Popular examples of website builders include Wix and Squarespace. These platforms simplify the</p>
            <p>A page builder, on the other hand, is slightly different. Page builders are tools (often plugins)</p>
            <p>Website builders are great for quickly getting a website up and running because they limit</p>
            <p><strong>Note: </strong>While drag-and-drop tools are a game changer, you’ll still need a basic
                understanding of</p>

            <h3>Mobile Responsive</h3>
            <p>A mobile responsive website automatically morphs to fit the shape and size of the screen it’s</p>
            <p><a href="">More than 50%</a> of all web traffic comes from mobile devices, so mobile responsive design
                has</p>

            <h3>SSL</h3>
            <p>SSL stands for Secure Socket Layer. An SSL certificate encrypts the data sent between a website’s</p>
            <p>You can tell if a website is secure by looking for the padlock icon in your browser’s address bar:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A <strong>non-secure</strong> website starts with <strong>“https”</strong> (Hyper Text Transfer
                    Protocol).</li>
                <li>A <strong>secure</strong> website starts with <strong>“https”</strong>, where the “s” stands for
                    <strong>secure.</strong>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>SSL certificates have become standard for <strong>all websites</strong>, even those that don’t collect

            <h3>SEO</h3>
            <p>SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It’s the process of configuring your website to get</p>
            <p>SEO can seem like a large and complex topic—and it is—but at its core, it’s about creating</p>

                <li>People actually want to read, share, or link to.</li>
                <li>Is properly formatted on your site (known as On-Page SEO).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>That said, there’s a lot of confusion and wildly unrealistic expectations around SEO. It’s important</p>

            <h3>Google Analytics</h3>

            <p>To use Google Analytics, all you need to do is install a small tracking script on your website, and</p>

            <h3>Email Service Provider (ESP)</h3>
            <p>An <strong>email service provider</strong> (sometimes called an email management service or EMS) helps
                you</p>
            <p>Popular examples of email service providers include MailChimp, Aweber (which we use),</p>
            <p>Using an email service provider offers several key benefits:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Automation: </strong>Users can add or remove themselves from your list automatically. You
                    can</li>
                <li><strong>Scalability: </strong>Send a single broadcast email to hundreds or thousands of subscribers
                    with</li>
                <li><strong>Deliverability: </strong>Email service providers are “whitelisted,” so your messages are
                    less likely to</li>
                <li><strong>Compliance: </strong>Helps you stay compliant with email regulations like the CAN-SPAM Act
                    to</li>
                <li><strong>Reporting & Tracking: </strong>See valuable stats like email open rates, link clicks, and
