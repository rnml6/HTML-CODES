            <h2>Header</h2>
            <p>Header is the upper (top) part of the webpage. Being the area people see before scrolling the page in</p>
            <p>Headers may include a bunch of meaningful layout elements, for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>basic elements of brand identity, usually a logo</li>
                <li>call-to-action button</li>
                <li>links to basic categories of website content</li>
                <li>links to the social networks</li>
                <li>basic contact information (telephone number, e-mail address, etc.)</li>
                <li>switcher of the languages in case of the multilingual interface</li>
                <li>search field</li>
                <li>subscription field or button</li>
                <li>links to interaction with the product such as trial version, downloading from</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It doesn’t mean that all the mentioned elements should be included in one web page header: in this</p>
            <img src="" alt=" ">
            <i>Shipping company website uses the header zone effectively: it includes a company logo in the left corner
                and the prominent</i>
            <p>What makes a header a vital element contributing to web usability is the fact that it is placed in the
            </p>
            <p>Some of the popular design practices for web headers include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>hamburger menu:</strong> hiding the set of links to different pages or sections</li>
                <li><strong>sticky header:</strong> header that doesn’t hide away but sticks to the top part of</li>
                <li><strong>two-layer navigation:</strong> a sort of double set of navigation sites in the header</li>
            </ul>
            <p>One more widely-used pattern for website headers is making a logo clickable and opening or</p>
            <img src="" alt=" ">
            <i>Bennett Tea website uses a stylish and minimalist sticky header, with the brand element in the center,
                links to core pages in</i>
            <h2>CTA Button</h2>
            <p>A <a href="">call-to-action (CTA) button</a> is an element of a user interface aimed at encouraging a
                user to take a</p>
            <p>Effective call-to-action buttons are easy to notice; designers intentionally create them so that</p>
            <img src="" alt=" ">
            <i>About page for ShipDaddy website is a good example of the call-to-action element instantly noticeable in
                the general</i>
            <img src="" alt=" ">
            <i>The web page for Mayple is formed of several sections and uses a set of consistent call-to-action buttons
                for each combining</i>
            <h2>Hero Section</h2>
            <p>Hero section is the above-the-fold pre-scroll area of the web page containing the element that</p>

            <img src="" alt=" ">
            <i>Options for a hero section design on a landing page design for Uni fintech service</i>

            <i>Hero section for the home page on the Energizou website catches attention and impresses visitors with a
                beautiful animated</i>
            <h2>Footer</h2>
            <p>Footer is the lower (bottom) part of the web page which usually marks its end. Being another common</p>
            <p>Footers can include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>brand identity signs, usually the name and logo of the company or product</li>
                <li>links to user support sections, for example, FAQ page, About page, Privacy Policy, Terms and
                    Conditions, Support Team, etc.</li>
                <li>credits to website creators</li>
                <li>contact forms and information</li>
                <li>links to company or product accounts in social networks</li>
                <li>testimonials and badges</li>
                <li>certification signs</li>
                <li>subscription field or button.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As well as the header, the footer is not the element found in all websites users can come across the</p>
            <img src="" alt=" ">
            <h2>Slider</h2>
            <p>Slider is an interactive element that applies a technique of a slideshow or carousel to present</p>
            <p>Sliders present controversial interactive elements that often become an object of hot debates.</p>
            <li>saving space on the page</li>
            <li>user engagement</li>
            <li>attractive visual hook</li>
            <p>However, even though the advantages sound really good, there are also obvious pitfalls:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>page speed decreasing due to slider functionality, this way influencing</li>
                <li>display of several equal options together, which may hurt usability and get</li>
                <li>possible problems of sliders in the mobile adaptation of the website</li>
                <li>as well as banners, sliders can be perceived as ads and skipped</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So, deciding upon slider integration into the web layout, designers must consider all pros and cons</p>
            <img src="" alt=" ">
            <h2>Search</h2>
            <p>Internal search is a functionality that enables a visitor to browse the content inside the website and
            </p>
            <p>If your website is made of 50+ pages, it’s high time you considered applying the internal search. Well-
            </p>
            <p>Another vital point to mention is that designers shouldn’t prioritize search over navigation in a user
            </p>
            <p>In case you have a single-page website, if your app or website is concise and not heavily packed</p>
            <img src="" alt=" ">
            <h2>Menu</h2>
            <p>The menu is one of the core navigation elements in user interfaces. It is a graphical control that</p>
            <p>Menus can have different locations in the interface (side menus, header menus, footer menus, etc.)</p>
            <img src="" alt=" ">
            <i>Interactions with a menu on the event booking website</i>
            <p>Menus can be organized horizontally or vertically. Some popular types found on diverse websites are:</p>
            <p><strong>Classic horizontal menu:</strong>the most common and well-recognized type of menu which presents
                the</p>
            <p><strong>Sidebar menu:</strong>quite a classic type, presents a vertical list of options sticking to the
                left or right side of</p>
            <p><strong>Dropdown menu:</strong>a more complex type of menu for content-heavy websites; here, the list of
            </p>
            <p><strong>Megamenu:</strong>that’s the complex expandable menu in which the big list of multiple choices is
            </p>
            <p><strong>Hamburger menu:</strong>when the hamburger button (typically marked with three horizontal lines)
                is clicked,</p>
            <img src="" alt=" ">
            <i>The e-commerce website selling glasses uses the vertical menu with primary navigation in the top left
                corner of the page.</i>
            <img src="" alt=" ">
            <i>The book festival website uses a hamburger menu opening the access main pages.</i>
            <h2>Breadcrumbs</h2>
            <p>Breadcrumbs are navigation elements used to support users in a journey around the website: they</p>
            <p>Some of the benefits of breadcrumbs are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>increased findability:</strong> breadcrumbs give users another touchpoint to the</li>
                <li><strong>fewer clicks needed:</strong> with breadcrumbs, website visitors can jump from</li>
                <li><strong>effective use of screen space:</strong> crafted well, breadcrumbs take a narrow</li>
                <li><strong>no misinterpretation:</strong> breadcrumbs are hardly ever misunderstood by users:</li>
                <li><strong>lower bounce rate:</strong> breadcrumbs are a great support for first-time visitors</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As well as with internal website search, breadcrumbs are helpful in cases when the website has</p>
            <img src="" alt=" ">
            <i>The product page on the e-commerce website uses a breadcrumb trail as a secondary level of
                navigation.</i>
            <h2>Form</h2>
            <p>Form is an interactive element that allows users to send information to the system or server. In a</p>
            <p>As forms present the actual point of communication between the user and the digital product, they</p>
            <img src="" alt=" ">

            <i>This page of the ecotourism website features a contact form with which visitors can tune their
                search.</i>
            <h2>Cards</h2>
            <p>Cards, also called tiles, are layout elements that help arrange and visualize homogeneous data or</p>
            <img src="" alt=" ">
            <i>The Chinese restaurant website uses an irregular grid of cards to present the menu of the restaurant.</i>

            <i>Art Institute blog uses ultra-minimalistic cards, separated only by negative space but organized clearly
                to be distinguished.</i>
            <img src="" alt=" ">
            <i>On the plant shop website, cards help to organize the options of related items.</i>
            <h2>Video</h2>
            <p>Video is not a really basic part of a web page, but with the progress of web development solutions</p>
            <p>Videos have become a popular visual hook applied to the hero section mentioned above. As well, we</p>

                the hero section,</i>
            <h2>Progress Indicator</h2>
            <p>Progress indicator is a small but helpful element that helps the visitor to understand the current point

            <p>Also, progress trackers support users in cases of long and complex forms or processes that demand</p>

            <i>Favicon design for Uplyfe landing page</i>
            <h2>Tags</h2>
